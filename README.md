# caddy release downloader

This tool should help to provide reliable builds for the [caddy-full-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/caddy-full-bin/) AUR package.
Caddy builds will be downloaded, using [travis](https://travis-ci.org/klingtnet/caddy-release-downloader), each time a new tag is pushed to the repository.
